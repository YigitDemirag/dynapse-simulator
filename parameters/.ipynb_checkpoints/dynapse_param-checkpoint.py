"""
This dictionary contains the default parameters for the
Differential Pair Integrator (DPI) neuron including synapses as implemented on
the DYNAP-SE chip, developed at the Institute of Neuroinformatic.
Circuit and equations were published in Chicca et al. 2014
These values were estimated empircally based on the example in the tutorial.
These parameters may serve you as a starting point for a given experiment.
