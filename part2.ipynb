    "In the second part, we will calculate the F-F curve of silicon neurons. In neuroscience, the F-F curve is a function that relates to the input firing rate and the output firing rate of a neuron. Because the F-F curve only specifies the firing rate rather than exact spike times, it is a concept suited to the rate coding rather than the temporal coding model of neuronal computation. To obtain the F-F curve, we will simulate silicon neurons with a range of spike frequencies and observe the output behavior."
